1. Login to MySQL and view all databases already present. You should get following result:

    => Create database db1;
    => show databases;


2. Write an SQL statement to create a simple table countries including columns country_id,
    country_name and region_id. After this display the structure of  table as below :

    => create table countries( country_id int(11), country_name varchar(20), region_id int(11));


3. Write an SQL statement to create a table named jobs including columns job_id, job_title, 
    min_salary, max_salary and check whether the max_salary amount exceeding the upper limit 
    25000. Also set job_id as primary key and entering null values for job_title is not allowed.

    => create table jobs(job_id int primary key, job_title varchar(20) not null, 
        max_salary float(7,2), min_salary float(7,2));
    => alter table jobs modify column max_salary float(7,2) check (max_salary >= 25000);
    => insert into jobs(job_id, job_title, max_salary, min_salary) values 
        (100,"python",25000,15000);


4. Write a SQL statement to create a table named job_histry including columns employee_id, 
    start_date, end_date, job_id and department_id

    => create table job_histry(employee_id int, start_date Date,end_date Date, department_id int);


5. Write an SQL statement to alter a table named countries to make sure that no duplicate 
    data against column country_id will be allowed at the time of insertion.

    => alter table countries add primary key (country_id);


6. Write an SQL statement to create a table named jobs including columns job_id, job_title, 
    min_salary and max_salary, and make sure that, the default value for job_title is blank 
    and min_salary is 8000 and max_salary is NULL will be entered automatically at the 
    time of insertion if no value assigned for the specified columns.

    => alter table jobs modify column job_title varchar(20) default "bank", 
        modify column min_salary float(6,2) default 8000.00;

7. Create a Department table with following structure

    => create table dept (dept_id int, name varchar(20), manager_id int, loc_id int,
        primary key (dept_id, manager_id));
    => alter table dept modify dept_id int default 0, modify manager_id int default 0;


8. Write an SQL statement to create a table employees including columns
    employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone_number hire_date, job_id,
    salary, commission, manager_id and department_id and make sure that, the
    employee_id column does not contain any duplicate value at the time of
    insertion and the foreign key columns combined by department_id and
    manager_id columns contain only those unique combination values, which
    combinations are exists in the departments table.

    => create table employee(eid int primary key, first_name varchar(20), last_name varchar(20),
        email varchar(20), phone int(11), job_id int, salary float(7,2),
        manager_id int, department_id int);
    => alter table employee add foreign key (department_id, manager_id)
        references dept (dept_id, manager_id) on delete set null;
